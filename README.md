Steel is a lightweight Rust implementation of the Minecraft server, partially based on [Pumpkin](https://github.com/Pumpkin-MC/Pumpkin).  
It focuses on clean code, performance, extensibility, and ease of use.

## ⚙ How to Contribute

1. Identify a feature you'd like to add or an issue to work on.
   You should always create a post in the channel [feature-discussion](https://canary.discord.com/channels/1428487339759370322/1429074039015473272) when considering adding a major feature.
2. Decompile the latest version of Minecraft using Parchment mappings.  
   *(the `master` branch currently targets Minecraft **1.21.11**).*

   Alternatively, you may use [GitCraft](https://github.com/WinPlay02/GitCraft) for this task.

   If you choose to use GitCraft, run the command 
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run --args="--mappings=mojmap_parchment --only-stable"
   ```
   in the GitCraft directory and keep in mind that you *may* have to implement this [change](https://github.com/WinPlay02/GitCraft/pull/29).
3. Fork the `master` branch of this repository.  
4. Examine the vanilla implementation and translate it into idiomatic Rust as cleanly and efficiently as possible.  
5. Commit your changes to your fork and open a pull request.
