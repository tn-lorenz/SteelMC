//! Structure start and reference types for chunk-level structure tracking.
//!
//! In vanilla, chunks store two maps:
//! - `structureStarts`: structures originating in this chunk
//! - `structuresReferences`: references to structures from nearby chunks
//!
//! Structure generation is not yet implemented. These types support
//! persistence, the proto-chunk → level-chunk data flow, and future generation.
//! The structure key is `Identifier` until a structure registry is added.
